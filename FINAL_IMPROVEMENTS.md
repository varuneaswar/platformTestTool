# Final Improvements - October 19, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… HTML Not Showing All Values
**Problem**: Some columns in the sample metrics table were not properly displaying values (showing empty cells or "NaN").

**Solution**:
- Added explicit handling for `None` and `NaN` values
- Set default values for each column type:
  - Error fields â†’ empty string `''`
  - Memory/CPU â†’ `0.0`
  - Rows affected â†’ `0`
  - Other fields â†’ `'N/A'` displayed
- Ensured all 18 columns are filled with correct values:
  - `test_case_id`, `file_name`, `operation`, `complexity`
  - `duration`, `success`, `rows_affected`
  - `start_time_iso`, `end_time_iso`
  - `thread_name`, `query_gist`
  - `error`, `error_code`, `return_code`
  - `memory_usage`, `cpu_time`, `job_id`, `user_id`

### 2. âœ… Graphs Not Showing Differentiation by Operations/Complexity
**Problem**: Graphs claimed to show breakdown by operations or complexity but colors/lines weren't distinct enough.

**Solution**:
- **Duration Distribution**: Now uses consistent color scheme by complexity:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green (`#4CAF50`) = Simple queries
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (`#FFC107`) = Medium queries
  - ðŸ”´ Red (`#F44336`) = Complex queries
- **Success Rate Timeline**: Added distinct line styles + colors:
  - Solid line + Green = Simple
  - Dashed line + Yellow = Medium  
  - Dash-dot line + Red = Complex
  - Added markers every 20 points for clarity
- **Duration Boxplot**: Color-coded boxes with legend:
  - Shows Median (red solid line) and Mean (blue dashed line)
  - Consistent color scheme across all plots
- **Interactive Plots**: Updated to use complexity as primary dimension (more useful than operation)

### 3. âœ… Summary Not Split by Read/Write Operations
**Problem**: Summary only showed overall statistics, no breakdown by operation type.

**Solution**:
- Added **"Breakdown by Operation Type"** table with columns:
  - Read Operations (select, find)
  - Write Operations (insert, update, delete)
  - All Operations (total)
- Metrics shown:
  - Total Queries
  - Success Rate (%)
  - Avg Duration (s)
  - P95 Duration (s)
  - Rows Processed
- Added **"Breakdown by Query Complexity"** table showing:
  - Query Count per complexity
  - Success Rate per complexity
  - Avg Duration per complexity
  - P95 Duration per complexity

### 4. âœ… Sample Metrics Limited to 50 Rows
**Problem**: Table showed 100 rows which was too many for quick review.

**Solution**:
- Limited sample to first 50 queries (changed from 100)
- Maintained all 18 columns with proper formatting
- Ensured every cell has a value (no empty/NaN cells)
- Added "N/A" placeholder for truly missing data

## Visual Improvements

### Color Scheme (Consistent Across All Plots)
- **Simple** queries: Green (#4CAF50)
- **Medium** queries: Yellow/Amber (#FFC107)
- **Complex** queries: Red (#F44336)

### Enhanced Legends
- Show sample counts: e.g., "Simple (n=3,245)"
- Positioned clearly (upper right for histograms, lower left for timelines)
- Semi-transparent background for readability
- Larger font size (11pt) for better visibility

### Better Differentiation
- Multiple visual cues (color + line style + markers)
- Higher DPI (150) for crisp plots
- Thicker lines (2.5pt) with markers
- Clear titles mentioning "by Complexity" or "by Operation"

## HTML Report Structure

### Now Organized As:
1. **Interactive Visualizations** (top section)
   - 4 clickable buttons for interactive HTML plots
   
2. **Static Plots** (embedded)
   - Duration Distribution by Complexity
   - Success Rate Timeline by Complexity
   - Duration Boxplot by Complexity

3. **Summary Section** (split into 3 parts)
   - **Overall Statistics**: Total metrics across all queries
   - **Breakdown by Operation Type**: Read vs Write comparison
   - **Breakdown by Query Complexity**: Simple vs Medium vs Complex

4. **Sample Query Metrics**
   - First 50 queries
   - All 18 columns filled
   - Color-coded success indicators
   - Formatted numbers (6 decimals for duration, 2 for memory/CPU)
   - Monospace font for SQL queries

## Test Verification

### Test Run: O91KpaIP7hbYxyFZHgiXU1dO
- âœ… Duration: 65 seconds
- âœ… All plots generated with correct colors
- âœ… HTML report includes Read/Write breakdown
- âœ… Sample metrics limited to 50 rows  
- âœ… All columns properly filled with values
- âœ… Complexity clearly differentiated in graphs
- âœ… Interactive plots functional

### File Sizes (Indicating Proper Generation)
- `duration_distribution.png`: ~58 KB
- `success_rate_timeline.png`: ~56 KB
- `duration_by_complexity.png`: ~51 KB
- Interactive HTML files: 200-400 KB each

2. âœ… Graphs clearly differentiate by complexity with colors/styles
3. âœ… Summary split into Overall, Read/Write, and Complexity breakdowns
4. âœ… Sample metrics limited to 50 rows with all columns filled

The soak test framework now provides **comprehensive, visually clear reports** with proper data presentation!
