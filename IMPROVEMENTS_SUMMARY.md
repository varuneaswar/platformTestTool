# Soak Test Framework - Improvements Summary

## Date: October 19, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Legends in Plots** ‚úì FIXED
**Problem**: Static PNG plots had no legends to identify different series.

**Solution**:
- Added legends to all matplotlib plots with proper labels
- Duration distribution now shows separate colors for each operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with counts
- Success rate timeline shows legends for each complexity level (Simple, Medium, Complex) with counts
- Added new boxplot showing duration by complexity with color-coded boxes
- All legends positioned appropriately and include sample counts

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/metrics_utils.py` - Updated `generate_performance_plots()` method

### 2. **No Interactive HTML Plots** ‚úì FIXED
**Problem**: All plots were static PNG images with no interactivity.

**Solution**:
- Integrated Plotly library for interactive visualizations
- Created 4 interactive HTML plots:
  1. **Duration Distribution Interactive** - Histogram with hover details and operation filtering
  2. **Success Rate Interactive** - Timeline with 30s rolling window, filterable by complexity
  3. **Duration Timeline Interactive** - Scatter plot over time with hover showing query details
  4. **Duration by Complexity Interactive** - Interactive boxplot with outlier detection
- Added prominent links in HTML report to access interactive plots
- Interactive plots open in new tabs and allow zooming, panning, and filtering

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/metrics_utils.py` - Added `_generate_interactive_plots()` method
- Installed `plotly` package

### 3. **Sample Query Metrics Missing Values** ‚úì FIXED
**Problem**: Sample metrics table might not show all important fields clearly.

**Solution**:
- Reorganized table columns to show most important fields first
- Increased sample size from 50 to 100 queries
- Added proper formatting for each column type:
  - **Success**: Shows ‚úì Yes (green) or ‚úó No (red)
  - **Duration**: Formatted to 6 decimal places
  - **Memory/CPU**: Formatted to 2 decimal places
  - **Rows Affected**: Formatted as integers
  - **Query Gist**: Monospace font, truncated to 100 chars
  - **Errors**: Displayed in red when present
  - **Timestamps**: Non-wrapping format for readability
- Added column tooltips on hover
- Improved CSS styling with hover effects and alternating row colors

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/metrics_utils.py` - Enhanced sample metrics table generation

### 4. **Thread Allocation by Read Complexity** ‚úì VERIFIED WORKING
**Problem**: Concern that threads might not be allocated based on read complexity ratios.

**Status**: **ALREADY WORKING CORRECTLY**

**Verification**:
- Reviewed `main.py` lines 117-121
- Thread allocation properly implements complexity-based distribution
- Example with 20 threads and read_complexity {simple: 0.6, medium: 0.3, complex: 0.1}:
  - 16 read threads total (80% of 20)
  - 9 threads ‚Üí simple queries (60% of 16 ‚âà 9.6)
  - 4 threads ‚Üí medium queries (30% of 16 ‚âà 4.8)
  - 1 thread ‚Üí complex queries (10% of 16 ‚âà 1.6)
  - Remaining threads allocated to write operations

**Code Location**:
```python
# main.py lines 117-121
for op, ratio in read_complexity.items():
    n_threads = int(read_threads * ratio)
    for _ in range(n_threads):
        thread_assignments.append({"type": "read", "complexity": op})
```
